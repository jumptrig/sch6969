      <p class="list-group-item_text img-responsive col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance.

        Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.
        
        To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work. An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.
        
        Attendance management system keeps track of daily attendance, working hours, breaks, login, and logout time. It prevents staff's time theft. An attendance management system integrates all attendance devices such as smart cards, biometric, and facial recognition devices in real-time.
        
        MasterSoft's Student attendance management software allows schools of all sizes to manage various attendance requirements. This system makes it easy to create daily attendance reports, absentee lists, letters and other documents almost effortlessly. Student attendance system helps teachers to mark online attendance of students during class & reduce manual work. It is used to track student's attendance, absentee record, attendance history & other related documents. Student attendance software allows you to record & manage daily student attendance to speed up the daily attendance process.
        
        Online attendance management system enables school administrators to record, manage & compile daily student attendance data. Along with student attendance, this software also allows teachers to generate 100% accurate student attendance reports.</p>
